# MarQSim: Reconciling Determinism and Randomness in Compiler Optimization for Quantum Simulation

Artifact for paper _MarQSim: Reconciling Determinism and Randomness in Compiler Optimization for Quantum Simulation_

---

## System Requirement

**Hardware**:

* 40GB+ available hard drive
* 32GB+ RAM
* CUDA GPU (highly recommended for faster evaluation)

**Software**:

* Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 server is tested)
* Python 3.10+

## Setup

We will use Python virtual environment together with Jupyter notebook. To set up and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now use your favorite Jupyter notebook frontend to execute the code (vscode, browser, etc.)

## Results

Layout may be different from the original paper. Slight variation is expected as the simulation and MarQSim itself introduces randomness.
