This file will guide you how to reproduce the experiments show on MarQSim paper.

To reproduce Fig. 14, run: python3 exp.py --experiment=overall
To reproduce Fig. 15, run: python3 exp.py --experiment=varying
To reproduce Fig. 16, run: python3 exp.py --experiment=spectra
To reproduce Fig. 17, run: python3 exp.py --experiment=evol
To reproduce Table. 2, run: python3 exp.py --experiment=time

Note: You can also copy and paste each command string from the experiment list and execute them individually. This way, a process indicator will be displayed as well.

    We provide the command for running experiments and incrementally gathering the data.
    You can define the sampling_time argument for each experiment, as long as the total sampling_time adds up to 20
    (with the exception of Pauli_BeH2_unf, which should adds up to 5).
    For each data collection run, make sure to change the random_seed argument. Otherwise, you'll end up collecting the same data multiple times.
    The results will be automatically gathered and saved in "result.csv" under the corresponding molecule/ion folder under "Overall_Parallel".
    This file supports incremental appending â€” existing data will not be overwritten.
    After finishing the data collection, execute the data.py under "Overall_Parallel" for data processing.
