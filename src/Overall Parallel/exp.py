### We provide the command for running experiments and incrementally gathering the data.
### Now you can define the sampling_time argument for each experiment, as long as the total sampling_time adds up to 20
### (with the exception of Pauli_BeH2_unf, which should adds up to 5).
### For each data collection run, make sure to change the random_seed argument. Otherwise, you'll end up collecting the same data multiple times.
### The results will be automatically gathered and saved in "result.csv" under the corresponding molecule/ion folder.
### This file supports incremental appending â€” existing data will not be overwritten.
